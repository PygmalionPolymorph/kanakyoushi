## Kanakyoushi - The Kana Teacher

Kanakyoushi is a small webapp to practice the japanese [Kana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana "Wiki") alphabets.
You can check it out [here](http://kanakyoushi.herokuapp.com)

It was primarily written for me as a test project for the frameworks used: [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/).
However, it was never quite finished.
If you should have interest in this app though, you can open an issue or leave me a message and i might be working on it again. :)
